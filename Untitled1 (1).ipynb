    "Python uses the term \"multithreading\" to describe a program's capacity to run many threads simultaneously. Within a programme, a thread is a unique flow of execution. A Python programme can execute many processes concurrently by using threads, which improves performance and responsiveness.\n",

    "When a programme needs to handle several activities at once, such as managing several user requests, processing a lot of data, or executing I/O operations, multithreading is frequently utilised. It enables the programme to utilise system resources more effectively and can greatly increase the program's overall effectiveness.\n",

Daemonic and non-daemonic threads are both included in this. It can be useful for keeping track of a program's active thread count.\n",

It's critical to remember that each thread should only get one call to start().\n",

    "join(): This function is used to watch for a thread to finish running. The caller thread can use join() to wait for the completion of the thread it is joining after starting a thread using start(). Until the connected thread is finished, the caller thread will block. This is helpful if you want to be sure that each thread has completed its work before moving on or if you need to synchronise the execution of several threads.\n",
